Hepatitis is a chronic disease with the potential to cause a worldwide health care crisis. 
Hepatitis means injury to the liver with inflammation of liver cells. It is caused by alcohol
and some other toxins. It is an excessively increased disease and becoming one of the most fatal
diseases in several countries. It involves machine learning algorithms and techniques to analyze medical data.
However early prediction of hepatitis is a quite challenging task. Machine learning is an emerging scientific field 
in data science with the ways in which machines learn from experience. The aim of this project is to develop a system 
which can perform early prediction of hepatitis based on the condition of the patient with high accuracy by combining 
the results of different machine learning techniques.
