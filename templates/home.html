<p>
Hepatitis is a chronic disease with the potential to cause a worldwide health care crisis. Hepatitis means injury to the liver with inflammation of liver cells. 
It is caused by alcohol and some other toxins. It is an excessively increased disease and becoming one of the most fatal diseases in several countries. It involves 
machine learning algorithms and techniques to analyze medical data. However early prediction of hepatitis is a quite challenging task. Machine learning is an 
emerging scientific field in data sciencewith the ways in which machines learn from experience. The aim of this project is to develop a system which can perform early 
prediction of hepatitis based on the condition of the patient with high accuracy by combining the results of different machine learning techniques.
